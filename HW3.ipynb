    "Homework will be posted to the course website. \n",
    "- **Format**: We expect students to complete the homework notebooks using Google Colab (see Discussion 1), but this is not explicitly required and you may use whatever software you would like to run notebooks. \n",
    "- **Answers**: As a general guiding policy, you should always try to make it as clear as possible what your answer to each question is, and how you arrived at your answer. Generally speaking, this will mean including all code used to generate results, outputting the actual results to the notebook, and (when necessary) including written answers to support your code.\n",
    "- **Submission**: Homeworks will be *submitted to Gradescope*, and we expect all students to do question matching on Gradescope upon submission.\n",
    "- **Late Policy**: All students are allowed 7 total slip days for the quarter, and at most 5 can be used for a single HW assignment. There will be no late credit if you have used up all your slip days. Also, your lowest HW grade will be dropped."
